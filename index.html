      <p>Greetings! My name is Victor Chung. I live in Seattle, Washington. I am a student at the UW Boot camp. I am hoping to be a 
        top-notch Web Developer in the very near future. Before this, I had a very successful small business in the automotive industry 
        selling vehicle and marine batteries, and also repairing vehicle charging and starting system. After 18 years, I decided it is
        time to try something different. 

      </p>I attended high school in the Willamette valley in Oregon, attended Bend community college and eventually transferred to the
        University of Oregon, in Eugene, Oregon. I graduated with a B.S in chemistry. I worked as a chemist for over 12 years. 
        I started working in a laboratory in Oregon which specializes in petroleum testing and environmental chemistry. Later, I worked for
        a testing laboratory in Kelso, Washington which specializes in environmental chemistry. Few years later, I was laid off from this 
        job and decided to move up to the Seattle area. In Seattle, I found a job as an analytical chemist, and after one year, I was promoted
        to the manager position. Four years later, environmental chemistry and testing laboratories weren't doing too well. Many laboratories
        in the area were closing. Soon, we had to close the laboratory too. Unfortunately, I was not able to find employment 
        in this field.</P>

      <p>I enrolled in Edmonds Community College in Edmonds, Washington and got my Associate degree in computer networking. I worked as a
          Network Analyst for about 4 years. During this time, mergers and acquisitions were common and corporations were hiring consultants 
          more than employees. After the corporation I worked for was taken over by another corporation, and the entire IT staff was replaced 
          by the new corporation's IT staff, I found myself unemployed again. By this time, the dot.com bust wasn't helping at all in finding 
          a new job. This was when I decided to be self-employed. 
          </p>

      <p>In my business, I worked long and hard and it was where I was able to earn enough money to invest in real-estate. Currently, I own
        4 different properties in the Seattle area and I manage them all myself-finding tenants, repairing, renovations, and the accounting.
        This will be my source of income when I retire. I hope to hire a management firm in the future.

      </p>Besides work, I enjoy restoring classic cars. I had restored a few cars in the last few years. Some of the cars I had restored 
        were a 1967 MGB, a 1969 BMW 2002, a 1974 BMW 2002, and a 1974 Mazda Rotary engine pickup. Currently, I have 2 classic VW bus which
        I intend to restore during my retirement years. 

        <p>For sports, I am a very dedicated martial artist. I had studied a few martial arts styles in the past but now I only focus
          on I-Chuan and Southern Praying Mantis Kung Fu. Wrestling in high school was my first sport. I try to find time in my very hectic
          schedule to practice on a daily basis. As I get older, I am focusing more on the internal aspect of martial arts and the philosophy
          of it. In other words, less jumping around, moving slowly, and standing still. Yes, that's what we do in I-Chuan, standing still.         
          I also do lion dancing and had performed in various events in the past.
